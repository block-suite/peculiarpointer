# Peculiar Pointers

Make your WordPress site a little weird by adding a peculiar pointer.

The Peculiar Pointers block is a container block where everything inside that container will display a custom cursor. Just upload your pointer and then fill the container with whatever blocks you want. It's that easy.

#### I need pointers on where to find pointers.
Don't worry, we got you covered. Just head on over to the [WeirdPress cursor collection](https://weirdpress.club/pointers) and see all the weird stuff we have for you. 

#### I like this, who made it?
